Crosshairs Graphics for Meta-Analyses

## Description

In its current state, `metaplotr` just creates `crosshairs` plot. In the forseeable future it will be able to produce other graphics that summarize meta-analyses results. Forest, funnel, L'abbe, meta-analytic regression scatterplot, radial, etc.
